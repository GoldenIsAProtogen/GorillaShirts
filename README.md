**GorillaShirts** is a mod for Gorilla Tag. The mod is able to import community-made shirts into the game, which then can be worn and seen by others with the mod. You can create your own shirts using the [GorillaShirtsUnityProject](https://github.com/developer9998/GorillaShirtsUnityProject).

## Features
**GorillaShirts** has a variety of unique features. Here are some of the more notable ones:

- **Packs** - Used to organize your shirts and seperate them from one big pile. This is useful when trying to find a specific set of shirts.
- **Capture** - Used to take an image of the currently previewed shirt, and post the image to your BepInEx folder.
- **Randomize** - Used to randomized your current shirt pack, it might even assist you with finding that one shirt you've wanted to put on.
- **Tag Offset** - Used to adjust the nametag for the player, located at their upper chest, to make it still visible with a shirt equipped.
- **Invisibility** - Used when a shirt is worn by a player, that player will then turn invisible. The effects go away once the shirt is removed.

## Usage
**GorillaShirts** can be used with a stand which is located in the majority of maps in the game. These stands can be used to wear and remove your shirts.
